To create a material to colour the player.

Click on the **Albedo** colour swatch, and change the colour as you like. You can also play with the **Metallic** and **Smoothness** sliders for different effects.

### Apply the material

1. Select the `Player` object in the Hierarchy panel, and click the disclosure triangle to reveal the object children.

2. Select the material in the Project panel, and drag it onto the `Cube` object inside the `Player` object.
3. Do the same for the `Barrel` object. All done!

## Wrap-Up

Creating basic materials is super easy. Later, we'll be looking at applying textures to materials, and creating our own shaders.

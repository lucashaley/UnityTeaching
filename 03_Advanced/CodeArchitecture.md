## Introduction

*Code Architecture* is the practice of organising your code and class structure to best fit your project. Any given game will have a different architecture, as every game is different -- but there are _patterns_ common to a lot of games.

Over the first few weeks of the course we'll be looking at those patterns in the context of a potential game.

## Goal

To get an understanding of different approaches to game architecture, and how to apply design patterns.

## Process

We're going to slowly assemble an architecture for a first-person puzzle game. We're going to do it mainly without actually using code -- we're simply going to think through the whole architecture in the abstract.

Our starting point will be the Game Design Document. As usual, it will guide the functionality and thus the work we need to do.

## Wrap-Up

There is a lot of benefit in getting the architecture right before you start getting too deep into coding.

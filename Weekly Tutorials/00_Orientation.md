# Unit 00: Orientation

## Introduction

For this course, we'll be taking a dive into Unity as a game development platform. We'll be making a top-down shooter game over the next 12 weeks.

> This first unit will be light on information, as the majority of content is better presented in-person in the workshop. This document will help as a reminder.

## Goal

The goal of this unit is to become familiar with the Unity workspace and usage. These are fundamental skills that will be carried throughout the rest of the course and onwards.

## Process

### Opening Unity

Unity gets updated frequently, and often the different versions can have quite large codebase differences. To avoid issues with breaking code with updating, Unity has a separate application called Unity Hub that allows users to install different versions, and open projects in the correct versions.

Open Unity Hub from the Start menu, and create a new project using version [[NEED VERSION FROM ITS]].

From the selection of templates, choose the "Massey" template, and let Unity open.
